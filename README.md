I am a NLP/ML engineer with a broad interest in LLMs, AI Evaluation, Interpretability and Uncertainty Estimation. Based in Lisbon, Portugal.

I recently completed my PhD at [SARDINE](https://sardine-lab.github.io/) lab at Instituto Superior Técnico, supervised by [André F. T. Martins](https://andre-martins.github.io/) and [Chrysoula Zerva](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chryssa-zerva-7bb4a966). My doctoral research focused on enhancing the robustness of NLG evaluation models and developing methods that can quantify and communicate the uncertainty associated with their outputs. Specifically, I was working on uncertainty-aware machine translation (MT) evaluation, aiming to create more trustworthy systems which are robust to the variation observed across different languages and domains.
