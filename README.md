I am a PhD student at [SARDINE](https://sardine-lab.github.io/) lab at Instituto Superior Técnico, supervised by [André F. T. Martins](https://andre-martins.github.io/) and [Chrysoula Zerva](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chryssa-zerva-7bb4a966). 

I am broadly interested in language representations, NLP evaluation, interpretability and uncertainty estimation. Currently working on Machine Translation (MT) evaluation, aiming to create more trustworthy systems which are robust to the variation observed across different languages and domains.  Based in Lisbon, Portugal.
